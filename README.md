# Pill Counter

Current version: 0.0.2

This is an Android app to track medications and pills you take, allowing you to be aware of their current quantities so you avoid interrupting your treatment because you forgot to purchase more!

This is an official upgrade from the CLI Python version of this application (https://github.com/GabrielGRSilva/PC-Pill-Counter).

## USAGE

[In progress of refactoring from Python and readjusting base from StudentList]
